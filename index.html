            <h2>Jhaycoâ€™s Discography</h2>
            <p>Jhaycoâ€™s been dropping straight heat for years, mixing reggaetÃ³n, trap, and futuristic vibes like no one
                else. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of his biggest projects so far:
                <br>
                <br>
                ðŸ’¿ Famous (2019)
                The album that put Jhayco on the map! With hits like No Me Conoce and Easy, this one had everyone
                talking. A perfect mix of reggaetÃ³n and Latin trap that proved he was way more than just a songwriter.
            <ul>
                Bangers from this album:

            </p>
            <p>
                ðŸ’¿ Timelezz (2021)
                Jhayco leveled up with this one! More experimental beats, deeper lyrics, and collabs with heavy hitters
                like Anuel AA and Myke Towers. This album showed he was here to stay and keep evolving.

                <li>Tokyo</li>

                ðŸ’¿ Vida Rockstar (2024)

                rock influences. This album is pure energy from start to finish.
